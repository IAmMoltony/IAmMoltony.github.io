    <h1>Moltony's Abandoned Projects</h1>
    <p>Overtime I have written many, many, many programs and scripts. Many of them I abandon eventually. Here's a list of some
    of the projects I have abandoned.</p>

    <h2>Abandoned Project One: Dodge Them All</h2>
    <p>Dodge Them All was the first time I used <i>Java</i> for game development. It's a simple 2D game where you dodge colored
    squares. It's kind of like Touhou but without attacks or bomb and it's theoretically infinite. I made it when I was like 10.</p>
    <p>The game was published on GameJolt <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/dodgethemall/613793">here</a>. It even has a
    description:</p>
    <i><q>Dodge Them All is a small but intense game, where you have to dodge enemies and collect coins.<br>
    Introducing:

    <ul>
        <li>Very basic enemy that everyone can dodge</li>
        <li>Little bit faster enemy that 95% of people can dodge</li>
        <li>Enemy with AI that is chasing you</li>
        <li>Impossible boss (in my opinion) and his bullets</li>
        <li>And C R A Z Y enemy that flashes and it is fast</li>
    </ul>

    And we can't forget to mention the retro-styled sounds and art, that was made in paint. The art includes skins (pokerface, my GD icon, spiral and recursion) and enemies (the nerdy red one, :P one, doesn't know what is going on one and 3 variations of k r e j z i one).<br>

    Update 1.2: fixed bugs, added new splashes<br>

    And that is all! I think you will like this game. If you found bugs or something like that, let me know. #action #adventure #retro #arcade #other</q></i></p>
    <p>What a great description.</p>
    <p>So, how is the game actually like? Does it live up to the description? Let's take a look</p>
    <h2>How the Gameplay is Like</h2>
    <p>Opening up the game, we see the title screen:</p>
    <img src="./img_abandonware/dta-ts.png" alt="DodgeThemAll title screen, featuring the game name on top, bouncing squares in the background, and
    yellow text, called the splash, reading 'variable splash might have already been assigned'. On the bottom half of the screen, three buttons
    are visible: 'Play', 'Help' and 'Exit'.">
    <p>This is.. a title screen alright. Also it runs at like 5fps, which is not that surprising considering my system is really
    slow and the title screen background has bouncing blocks bouncing all over the place.</p>
    <p>Now let's finally look at the gameplay! Pressing play we are greeted to the following.</p>
    <img src="./img_abandonware/dta-firstplay.png" alt="The screen you see when clicking on 'Play' at the title screen. Text below
    describes the image quite well.">
    <p>First off, the game runs really poorly. But that is probably not the fault of the game having bad optimization, this is
    just my laptop (which is the same laptop I used to write this game) goofing off. Performance issues aside, let's look at the
    game. We can see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A white square. You play as him/them/her.</li>
        <li>A coin. When a coin is collected, you're given 110 score, I think.</li>
        <li>The HUD. It displays the player's health, score, current level, how many coins have been collected, how much score you need to level up,
            some instructions telling us to press space to open the shop and a FPS counter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each time you level up, an enemy spawns. Also, I encountered a bug where after going to the next level my character started
    constantly going down for no reason. Bugs are something this game has a lot of. I did do some playtesting but ultimately
    I had no idea what I was doing and couldn't really solve many issues. For example, there's a bug that causes coins not to produce
    sounds after collecting them (accompanied by an exception).</p>
    <p>The player has 100 health initially. When you run out of health, the game is over. The game over screen looks like this.</p>
    <img src="./img_abandonware/dta-over.png" alt="Dodge Them All's game over screen. It features the words 'Game over!' on the top
    of the screen. Below that, the level that the player was on when the game over happened is displayed. On the bottom of the screen
    a button for trying again is visible. The button text goes out of bounds of the button box.">
    <p>Yup that's the game over screen. Looks basic, just like everything else in this game. I mean, the description did state that
    its art was made in paint, so at least it's not lying.</p>
    <p>The game also has a boss, which is just a big red square shooting bullets, but I can't bother myself to actually play the
    game enough to get to it. Maybe you'll reach it, it's not that hard.</p>
    <p>The game also features a shop where you can buy upgrades. You can upgrade your speed (I don't know why you would do that in a
    bullet-hell game), upgrade max health and refill health, all for coins you collect.</p>
    <h2>Sound Design</h2>
    <p>There's one last thing I want to talk about before ending this section, and that is the game's <i>sounds</i>.</p>
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>The game's soundtrack is super basic and quite mid. It was made in a program called Bosca Ceoil, which is a simple tool
    for making music. There's nothing very special about it and it's like ten seconds long.</p>
    <h3>Sound Effects</h3>
    <p>The sound effects are all "retro-styled" as the description puts it. They're all quite basic and not really worth talking about
    in depth.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Dodge Them All truly shows how much I have come in game development and programming in general in a relatively short amount of
    time (~3 years). And even if this game isn't that special or that good, it still holds a special place in my heart.</p>
    <h1>Abandoned Project Two: Dodge Them All Rewrite</h1>
    <p>About a year after the release of DTA, I remade the entire game in Electron using JavaScript. Unlike the original,
    the rewrite is actually open source and can be found <a href="https://github.com/lispy2010/dodgethemall">here</a>, on GitHub. However,
    running it isn't as easy as just downloading and running an executable - you'll have to install Node.JS and Electron. I might want
    to publish precompiled builds.</p>
    <p>I don't really consider this one "unfinished" per se, since I see the game as very complete, but still decided to include it here
    just for no reason.</p>
    <p>When I tried to compile the game, I encountered several compilation issues. Luckily, all the compiled files were included in the
    source code, which is generally not what you're supposed to do but I didn't really know how to keep a GitHub repository back then
    so I'll let this one slide.</p>
    <h2>The Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Unlike the last game, this one runs really well. Maybe the original is badly optimized... Eh, either way, here's the title screen:</p>
    <img src="./img_abandonware/dta-rw-title.png" alt="DTARW title screen.">
    <p>Do you see it? <b><i>A STYLIZED FONT!!</i></b> Yep, instead of using a default font, this time we have a good font. That is very
    nice indeed. As per usual, the game's name, three buttons. Except this time, instead of an exit button we have a sandbox button. The sandbox
    is a feature that was supposed to be included in the original game, but in a tragic series of events I lost the original source code and
    couldn't write the feature anymore. Oh well. Instead of a yellow splash screen, we instead have a "Beta version!" label below the title
    text. This actually is a beta version, because I wanted to implement a couple features but I'm lazy ahh hell and I just forgot. Splash text
    is still in the game, but in a different form - now the game modifies the title of the window instead of adding text on the title screen.
    There are a total of a lot of splashes, half of which are making keyboard puns and jokes about this game being a rage game.</p>
    <p>Enough rambling let's get into the action!!!!!!</p>
    <img src="./img_abandonware/dta-rw-firstplay.png" alt="DTARW gameplay">
    <p>First impressions: way better than DTA. The background has little gray particles that kinda look like stars, the HUD is way better and the
    performance is ten billion percent better. You can even pause it by pressing Esc! The original game also technically had pause functionality
    when you go into the shop but having a dedicated pause screen is way nicer.</p>
    <p>And what do you see? An enemy! The game prepares you to dodge enemies right from the beginning instead of giving you a random coin and expecting
    you to collect it. The scoring system was also changed quite a bit. Instead of score incrementing every time you pick up a coin (which can be super
    difficult when reaching higher levels with more enemies), score instead goes up automatically each frame. The shop is still here, and
    worse than ever. The only item in the shop is a health boost - +10HP for 7 coins. Inflation really hit DTA...</p>
    <h3>New Enemies</h3>
    <p>The rewrite still includes all of the same enemies that the original Java edition has, but more. Here's the full list of new guys
    that joined the family:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The rainbow guy. He bounces like a ball and changes color like a rainbow. This is my first original enemy idea for this game,
            and it's quite cool imo.</li>
        <li>The brown guy. This is like the red guy who bounces, but like really really slow.</li>
        <li>The walking guy. He just walks...menacingly. He does not care about the player whatsoever.</li>
        <li>The snake guy. He moves in a sine wave, like a snake!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There's also the boss, but I'm not sure if he's actually functional. It's definitely a bug, since code that spawns the boss is
    included and I remember it working. idk...</p>
    <p>One of the defining features of this remake is the <i>sandbox</i>. This is a place where you can make your custom enemy!</p>
    <img src="./img_abandonware/dta-rw-sandbox.png" alt="DTARW sandbox screen. The player's custom enemy is contained in a box on the left.">
    <p>I'm quite proud of this interface. So clean, so nice... Desngning this was an absolute nightmare because of the sheer amount of UI elements
    in the sandbox. On the left, we have our custom enemy. He's in a box and can never escape. On the right, we can change the enemy however
    we want. First, we have the speed controls - changing the X and Y velocity. Below that is the enemy color chooser - red, green, blue,
    white, cyan, magenta, yellow and dark versions of all of them. there are two special buttons. The "?" button decides a color at random,
    and the "!" button brings up a box where you can set a color yourself based on RGB values. On the very bottom there is an enemy reset
    button which resets the enemy back to the same as a red one. Yeah, the sandbox is a bit underwhelming, but it is what it is.</p>
    <h3>Sound Design</h3>
    <p>The game does a bit better in terms of sound design. They're still "retro-styled" and there is nothing to say about them. They're
    alright. There's no background music to accompany you, though... I think that's better, actually. The ten-second track from the original
    can definitely make someone go nuts if they play for an extended period of time. Not that anyone would do that, however.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The Dodge Them All Rewrite is just a better, shinier, faster version of Dodge Them All. I don't know what to say, really. It's great
    you should play it if you really want to idk do whatever tf you want i dont care</p>
    <h1>Abandoned Project Three: JSHS</h1>
    <p>JSHS is a simple home server software written in JavaScript. I made it when trying to make a home server. But then I found out about
    CasaOS, which is a lot better, better, better, and also prettier. JSHS features a simple file manager, very primitive security in the form
    of a single password, and that's basically it. I abandoned it once I found about about Casa.</p>
    <h1>Abandoned Project Four: Pikurosu</h1>
    <p>Pikurosu is a Nonogram/Picross game for PC. It was superceded by nonoSharp, which is active and isn't pure spaghetti code. I stopped
    working on this when I found out that C isn't a great language for gamedev, and I was much more familiar with C#. So I switched to C# and
    made nonoSharp.</p>
    <img src="./img_abandonware/pikurosu-ns.png" alt="Left: pikurosu. Right: nonoSharp">
    <p>The above is a side-by-side comparison of Pikurosu and nonoSharp.</p>
    <h1>Abandoned Project Five: Squarity</h1>
    <p>NO NOT DTA AGAIN!!! This was supposed to be a rewrite of DTARW in C++. I simply did not want to.</p>
    <h1>Abandoned Project Six: Paint DS</h1>
