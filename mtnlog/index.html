        <h1>MtnLog library</h1>

        <p>
            MtnLog is a simple logging library written in C. I originally created it for <a href="../ds-craft/index.html">DS-Craft</a>,
            but then decided to separate them so that MtnLog can be reused in other projects.
        </p>
        <p>The library features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Logging into a file and into the console</li>
            <li>Colored logging</li>
            <li>Three log levels: info, warning and error</li>
            <li>Timestamps in logs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Adding the library into your project</h2>
        <p>
            The library is only distributed as source code, so you can just copy the source and header files into your project
            and use the library like that. Or, if you use <a href="https://git-scm.org">Git</a>, then you can add the library
            as a submodule.
        </p>
        <h2>Platform compatibility</h2>
        <p>
            MtnLog runs perfectly fine on Windows, Linux, Haiku and BSD. It should also work fine on MacOS.
        </p>
        <h2>Compiler compatibility</h2>
        <p>
            MtnLog tries to have support for many compilers. The library is known to work on:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://bellard.org/tcc">TCC (Tiny C compiler)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org">MinGW</a></li>
                <li>IntelÂ® oneAPI compiler</li>
            </ul>

            It has not, however, been tested with Microsoft's MSVC (Visual C++).
        </p>
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>
            MtnLog has documentation powered by <a href="https://doxygen.nl">Doxygen</a>. You can either build the docs locally on
            your computer, or <a href="docs/index.html">view documentation online</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Source code</h2>
        Source code for MtnLog can be found on <a href="https://github.com/IAmMoltony/libmtnlog">GitHub</a>.
