    </header><p><strong>Important!</strong> This entire post is wrong. Sorry about that. Click <a href="/blog/public/posts/libnds-pcx/">here</a> to find out what actually happened.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been trying to get PCX image files to load using libnds. I knew that GIMP supports many image formats, including PCX, so I made a new PCX image, saved it and then wrote code that displays it. After some tweaking&hellip; I got a cyan square. Weird! I started messing around with the code, trying to get it to work, but it either didn&rsquo;t display anything or displayed that dreaded cyan square. Looking at the documentation, I decided to print the BPP of the image, and&hellip; 1bpp. The image that I made was 8bpp, but the PCX loader thought it&rsquo;s 1bpp. So there must have been some issue with GIMP not saving my image properly. I tested the program with <code>ball.pcx</code>, which is included in libnds examples and is known to work. And sure enough, it just worked!</p>
<p>Never using GIMP for PCX files ever again.</p>
